## YouTube Trending Video Analysis
This project analyzes a dataset of over 40,000 trending YouTube videos collected over 205 days, focusing on insights from the USA and India. Using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, we explore key metrics such as views, likes, comments, and title characteristics to understand factors contributing to a video's trending status. The analysis aims to provide valuable insights for content creators and marketers looking to enhance their video popularity on YouTube.

**Goal of the analysis**
* How many views do our trending videos have? Do most of them have a large number of views? Is having a large number of views required for a video to become trending?
* The same questions above, but applied to likes and comment count instead of views.
* Which video remained the most on the trendin-videos list?
* How many trending videos contain a fully-capitalized word in their titles?
* What are the lengths of trending video titles? Is this length related to the video becoming trendy?
* How are views, likes, dislikes, comment count, title length, and other attributes correlate with (relate to) each other? How are they connected?
* What are the most common words in trending video titles?
* Which YouTube channels have the largest number of trending videos?
* Which video category (e.g. Entertainment, Gaming, Comedy, etc.) has the largest number of trending videos?
* When were trending videos published? On which days of the week? at which times of the day?
